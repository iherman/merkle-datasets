# Merkle Datasets

This is a proof-of-concepts implementation of the [Merkle Datasets](https://gist.github.com/iherman/40174d81be4b08ab43444c236d2181df) idea, written in Typescript.
It relies on the [@rdfjs/types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rdfjs/types) types and their 
implementation in [n3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n3) as an RDF runtime, and 
[rdfjs-c14n](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rdfjs-c14n) as in implementation of the
W3C [RDF Dataset Canonicalization](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-canon/) algorithm. The code has
been tested with [deno](deno.land) but it should run without change with Node.js+Typescript, or
in a browser.

There is an [API documentation](https://iherman.github.io/merkle-datasets), generated by [deno](deno.land).
